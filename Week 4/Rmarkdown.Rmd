## Sypnosis

This paper seeks to address the following questions based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database covering the period between 1950 and end in November 2011:

* Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

* Impacts on population health are represented within the data as injuries and fatalities and the are discussed separately below.

The economic impact is represented by the dual impacts of Crop and Property damage - these will be considered together to give an overall picture of economic impact.

## Loading of Dataset & Required Libraries

```{R message = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

FileDownloadLocation = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/"
File = "repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"

if(all(File %in% dir()) == FALSE) { 
        
        download.file(paste0(FileDownloadLocation, File), 
                       File, method = "curl")
} 
## set the number of rows to read in equal to the number of obs found in
## exploratory analysis to improve data load performance
storm_data <- read.table(File,  header = TRUE, sep = ",", nrows = 902298 )
dim(storm_data)
```
Relevant columns are selected
```{R}
storm_data <- storm_data[ , c(8, 23:28)] 
rm(storm_data_file)
head(storm_data)
```
```{R}
total_injuries <- aggregate(INJURIES~EVTYPE, storm_data, sum)
total_injuries <- arrange(total_injuries, desc(INJURIES))
total_injuries <- total_injuries[1:20, ]
total_injuries
total_fatalities <- aggregate(FATALITIES~EVTYPE, storm_data, sum)
total_fatalities <- arrange(total_fatalities, desc(FATALITIES))
total_fatalities <- total_fatalities[1:20, ]
total_fatalities
totals<- merge(total_fatalities, total_injuries, by.x = "EVTYPE", by.y = "EVTYPE")
totals<-arrange(totals,desc(FATALITIES+INJURIES))
names_events <- totals$EVTYPE
```
Data is now cleaned and ready for graph plotting.

## Results

### Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

Fatalities and Injuries are Merged

```{R}
barplot(t(totals[,-1]), names.arg = names_events, ylim = c(0,95000), beside = T, cex.names = 0.8, las=2, col = c("red", "yellow"), main="Top Disaster Casualties")
legend("topright",c("Fatalities","Injuries"),fill=c("red","yellow"),bty = "n")
```
Based on the above histogram, it can be observed that *Tornado* and *Heat* had caused the most number of fatalities and *Tornado* had caused most injuries in the United States between the period of 1995 to 2011.

## Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

### Data Processing
We need to convert property and cropt damage into numbers where H=10^2, K=10^3, M =10^6, and B=10^9. For this, we create two new variables: PROPDAMAGE, CROPDAMAGE

```{R}
storm_data$PROPDAMAGE = 0
storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$PROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$PROPDMG * 10^2
storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$PROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$PROPDMG * 10^3
storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$PROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$PROPDMG * 10^6
storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$PROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$PROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$PROPDMG * 10^9

storm_data$CROPDAMAGE = 0
storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$CROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$CROPDMG * 10^2
storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$CROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$CROPDMG * 10^3
storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$CROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$CROPDMG * 10^6
storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$CROPDAMAGE = storm_data[storm_data$CROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$CROPDMG * 10^9
```

Aggregate property and crop damage into one variable. Arrange and select the top 20.

```{R}
economic_damage <- aggregate(PROPDAMAGE + CROPDAMAGE ~ EVTYPE, storm_data, sum)
names(economic_damage) = c("EVENT_TYPE", "TOTAL_DAMAGE")
economic_damage <- arrange(economic_damage, desc(TOTAL_DAMAGE))
economic_damage <- economic_damage[1:20, ]
economic_damage$TOTAL_DAMAGE <- economic_damage$TOTAL_DAMAGE/10^9
economic_damage$EVENT_TYPE <- factor(economic_damage$EVENT_TYPE, levels = economic_damage$EVENT_TYPE)
head(economic_damage)
```

### Results

Graph showing cost of damages from severe weather events

```{R}
with(economic_damage, barplot(TOTAL_DAMAGE, names.arg = EVENT_TYPE, beside = T, cex.names = 0.8, las=2, col = "gold", main = "Total Property and Crop Damage by Top 20 Event Types", ylab = "Total Damage in USD (10^9)"))
```
